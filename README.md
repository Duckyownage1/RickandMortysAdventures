Rick and Morty characters

The approach I took was basically to have the individual Divs be cards that would hold pictures of each of the characters. I thought it would be a neat design that I have seen before with a simple animation to add to it. 

I ended up just using the Rick and Morty api with a for loop accessing all of the individual characteristics of the characters and applying them into divs using animation to access them.

The instructions to the site are basically you can click on the main button to make 20 first characters pop up or you can search them out by name and it will give you all of the characters that they have by that specific name up to 20. Also if you happen to misspell a name an alert will pop up notifying you that you cant spell and should try again!

I had some difficulty with the app doing modals and actually getting everything to click together because i had so many of the same div names at first. I ended up doing a simple animation because my modal was stacked on top of each other after i got it to "work" so I couldnt read anything that it was displaying
